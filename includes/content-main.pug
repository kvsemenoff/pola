						|Indentifying potential risks as early as possible in order to limit any losses is the first thing we consider when entering into any negotiations. The internal vetting procedures used
						|are structured and detailed, and these give
						|our commercial team the best opportunities
						|to conclude business whilst making sure the company’s global portfolio always bears minimum acceptable counter-party risk levels.
